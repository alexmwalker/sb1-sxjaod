<h2>Social Justice in New South Wales</h2>
<p>The most striking result from the Stocktake is the extraordinary consensus across Australia about what issues we are seeing.</p>
<h3>Housing affordability and homelessness</h3>
<p>Housing affordability and homelessness were overwhelmingly the top social justice concerns people saw in their community, irrespective of geography and socioeconomic status. An enormous 71 per cent of respondents identified these issues in their community and they were the most common concerns across seven out of eight Australian jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Housing and homelessness were in the top four issues in every single electorate in Australia. Only around half the number of people who identified this issue in their community identified it in their own lives (35.52 per cent), although this still places it as the second most common issue respondents had personally experienced.</p>
<p>Australia is experiencing a housing crisis. The 2021 census recorded that 122,494 people were homeless on any given night[^1] and the consensus is that this estimate will have increased. Australia has a shortfall of 640,000 social housing properties, an increase in shortfall of more than 200,000 since reported in the last Social Justice Stocktake.[^2]</p>
<p>The struggle to find affordable rentals is particularly pervasive amongst those on minimum wage with 82 per cent of properties unaffordable for families earning minimum wage, 98 per cent of properties unaffordable for single parents on minimum wage, and 100 per cent of properties unaffordable for persons on JobSeeker, retirees on the Age Pension and persons on Disability Support Pension.[^3]</p>

<h3>Mental health</h3>
<p>Mental health is the second most common social justice concern identified by respondents for their community but the most commonly experienced by respondents themselves. The number of people identifying mental health as an issue in their community is even higher than the number identifying it in the last survey where it was the most common issue identified. Mental health is connected to every other social justice concern raised in this report and particularly linked with housing stress and homelessness.[^4]</p>
<p>The Salvation Army’s own experience has shown that mental ill health can drive and result from other forms of disadvantage as well as exacerbate and be exacerbated by other experiences of hardship. When we consider mental health, we need to consider that a purely medical response must be complemented by actions that address underlying disadvantage. The best possible clinical care will be less effective if a person is living in their car or unsafe in their home.</p>
<h3>Financial hardship and inclusion</h3>
<p>Financial hardship and inclusion was identified by more than double the number of people in this survey as identified it in the last Stocktake. It was the third most common issue identified in both the community and in respondents’ own lives.</p>
<p>The cost of living crisis is affecting everyone in Australia but there are cohorts who are more likely to experience extreme disadvantage. The Salvation Army’s own research has shown that affording cost of living was the most cited challenge for respondents in the past year.[^5]</p>
<p>Nearly every respondent saw an increase in household expenses in the past year, making it difficult to make ends meet, and more than nine in 10 reported to have experienced financial stress.[^6] Work undertaken by Foodbank Australia identified that half of the Australian population has experienced some level of difficulty in meeting their basic food needs with cost of living being the most frequent reason.[^7]UnitingCare Australia has undertaken research showing that one in six Australian children are living in poverty.[^8]</p>
