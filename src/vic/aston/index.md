## Social Justice in Aston

The most striking result from the Stocktake is the extraordinary consensus across Australia about what issues we are seeing.

Bean, like the rest of Australia, is experiencing a housing crisis. In Bean, 71 per cent of people identified housing affordability and homelessness as an issue in the community and 31.8 per cent identified it as an issue for themselves. This is even higher than the result recorded in the 2022 Social Justice Stocktake of 66.1 per cent for housing affordability and 43.1 per cent for homelessness. The best estimates available suggest there are around 396 people experiencing homelessness in Bean alone1 and there is an unmet housing need of 1800 dwellings2. Not having a safe and secure home makes every part of life more difficult. Addressing issues in the housing system (and ending homelessness) is foundational to addressing the other social justice issues identified in this report.

The rising cost of living has impacted everyone in Australia in some way and Bean is no exception. 57.9 per cent of respondents in Bean reported that financial hardship and inclusion was an issue in their community and 36.4 per cent identified it when thinking about themselves. This compares with 18.3 per cent who identified the same issue for their community in the 2022 Stocktake. Though the overall child poverty rate in the ACT is 9.6 per cent, it is much higher in some areas, for example the suburb of Gilmore in Bean, where the child poverty rate is 22.1 per cent.3 Roughly 3085 people living in Bean are reliant on JobSeeker or Youth Allowance.4 The rates of both these payments are demonstrably too low and have the unintended consequence of trapping people in poverty.

Mental health was the third issue identified by people in Bean in terms of the community and the top issue for themselves. At the last Stocktake, mental health was identified by around 41.3 per cent of people in Bean. At the last Census, in Bean, 10 per cent of people reported being diagnosed with a long-term mental health condition, including depression or anxiety.5 Mental health is connected to every other social justice concern raised in this report and particularly linked with housing stress and homelessness.6 The Salvation Army’s own experience has shown that mental ill health can drive and result from other forms of disadvantage as well as exacerbate and be exacerbated by other experiences of hardship. When we consider mental health, we need to consider that a purely medical response must be complemented by actions that address underlying disadvantage. The best possible clinical care will be less effective if a person is living in their car or unsafe in their home.

Access to health care was introduced to the Social Justice Stocktake for the first time in 2025 and appeared in the top five issues in the vast majority of electorates. In Bean, 51.4 per cent identified it as an issue in the community and 29 per cent when thinking about their own lives. Nationally, there has been a decline in bulk billing across Australia by four per cent,7 with fewer than 25 per cent of GPs offering bulk billing across the country.8 In the ACT, 3.4 per cent of GP clinics offered bulk billing.9 In Bean, 6.7 per cent of GP clinics offered bulk billing.10 In the ACT, the average out of pocket cost, additional to the Medicare rebate for GP visits, was $49.39.11 In Bean, 18.5 per cent of people felt they had waited longer than acceptable for an appointment with a GP, slightly less than the national average of 18.6 per cent.12

In Bean, 43.9 per cent of people identified climate change as an issue in the community and as an issue for themselves. This is above the national result of 30.3 per cent. In the 2022 Social Justice Stocktake we only recorded the issues people identified in their community and 24.8 per cent identified climate change in Bean. The Climate Risk Map predicts that by 2050 with a ‘medium’ emission scenario, 1.9 per cent of properties in Bean will be at risk.13 An extraordinary 84 per cent of people in Australia have identified that they personally have been affected by a climate event or extreme weather14 so it is an indication of how serious the other social justice issues are that climate change, while ranking highly, does not rank higher.

Bean echoed the general sentiment of Australia when asked what could be done about these issues and what decision-makers needed to know. We heard from respondents in Bean a strong sense of urgency as well as reflection on the need for politics to be put to the side and immediate action taken.

### We have the power to make a difference

#### we can urge action from our governments

All governments can commit to ending homelessness. This will involve all governments working together to address the structural drivers of homelessness such as poverty, low income, and the lack of social and affordable housing. 

Critically, while the Housing Australia Future Fund is a start, it is critical that funding for affordable housing is not at the expense of social housing — both need to be fully funded. Governments need to work together to rapidly increase access to social housing, committing to building up social housing stock to be at least 10 per cent of total housing stock. This will relieve pressure across the entire housing continuum.

#### We can implement change in our community and our workplaces

Homelessness is extremely isolating and there are many places in our community where people experiencing homelessness do not feel welcome. Our community groups can ensure they remain open to people who are homeless by keeping the cost of activities and membership as low as possible or considering arrangements for lower fees for people experiencing financial hardship. Places of business can also make sure that people experiencing homelessness are welcome and do not experience stigma or discrimination when they are in public spaces. Community groups and businesses that have facilities might investigate whether they can create events or opportunities to share those facilities, such as having community dinners. We might also be able to make facilities such as showers and toilets available for use by members of the public who may not have access to a safe and secure place themselves.

### We can have influence in our personal lives

There is a lot of stigma and shame associated with experiencing homelessness. We can treat people experiencing homelessness or housing stress with dignity and respect. If we see someone in the street experiencing homelessness, we can stop and engage.
